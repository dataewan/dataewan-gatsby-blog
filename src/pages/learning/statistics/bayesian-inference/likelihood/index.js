        When you have your model, it is usually straightforward to calculate
        this likelihood. For a simple example, if we are modelling coin tosses
        as a fair coin being tossed, and we see two heads in a row,{" "}

          Picking a good model that you can parameterise is a key part of this
          process. Ben Lambert's book gives you this framework for picking a
          good model:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Write down the real life behaviour that the model should be
              capable of explaining.
            </li>
            <li>
              Write down the assumptions that it is believed are reasonable to
              achieve step 1.
            </li>
            <li>
              Look for probability models that are based on these assumptions.
              If necessary, combine multiple modles to capture all the
              assumptions.
            </li>
            <li>
              After fitting the model to the data, test its ability to explain
              the behaviour identified in step 1. If unsuccessful, go back to
              step 2 and assess which of your assumptions are invalidated. Then
              choose a new more general probability model that encompasses these
              new assumptions.
            </li>
          </ol>
